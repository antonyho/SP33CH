## Liberating and restoring Internet freedom of speech

A liberated discussion system that does not require account registration. No tracing on user activity.

## Vision

Do you feel annoying and doubtful while:
- you are going to join an interesting online discussion, but you have to registered first?
- Why do you need to provide e-mail address when they claim that they will never send you advertisement nor making a profit with it?
- Do you hestitate to say something true because every tiny bit of your Internet activity will be tracked?

### We should liberate the Internet activities, most essentially freedom of speech.

This discussion system aims to relax the the requirement for an Internet user to join a discussion. With minimal measure to avoid flooding and spambot. Use least Javascript library to make no tracking on user's activity. That's why the graphic interface and user experience is minimalism. And no tracking data means no ability for the site owner to provide user acitivities nor privacy to any party. And of course, no way to leak information when it doesn't even exist.
